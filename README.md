<H1>ENCRYPTION DECRYPTION USING CAESAR CIPHER ALGORITHM</H1>

The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique that was used by Julius Caesar to send secret messages to his allies. It works by shifting the letters in the plaintext message by a certain number of positions, known as the “shift” or “key”. The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the earliest and simplest methods of encryption techniques.

It’s simply a type of substitution cipher, i.e., each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter with a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. The method is apparently named after Julius Caesar, who apparently used it to communicate with his officials.
Algorithm for Caesar Cipher

# Input:
<h2>Choose a shift value between 1 and 25.
Write down the alphabet in order from A to Z.
Create a new alphabet by shifting each letter of the original alphabet by the shift value. For example, if the shift value is 3, the new alphabet would be:
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C
Replace each letter of the message with the corresponding letter from the new alphabet. For example, if the shift value is 3, the word “hello” would become “khoor”.
To decrypt the message, shift each letter back by the same amount. For example, if the shift value is 3, the encrypted message “khoor” would become “hello”.</h2>

# Procedure: 

<h2>Traverse the given text one character at a time .
For each character, transform the given character as per the rule, depending on whether we’re
encrypting or decrypting
the text.
Return the new string generated.</h2>

# Rules for the Caesar Cipher
1. Choose a number between 1 and 25. This will be your “shift” value.
2. Write down the letters of the alphabet in order, from A to Z.
3. Shift each letter of the alphabet by the “shift” value. For example, if the shift value is 3, A would become D, B would become E, C would become F, and so on.
4. Encrypt your message by replacing each letter with the corresponding shifted letter. For example, if the shift value is 3, the word “hello” would become “khoor”.
5. To decrypt the message, simply reverse the process by shifting each letter back by the same amount. For example, if the shift value is 3, the encrypted message “khoor” would become “hello”.
